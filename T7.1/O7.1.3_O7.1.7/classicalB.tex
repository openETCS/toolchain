\paragraph{Abstract} 

The B-Method is a formal method developed by J-R. Abrial and used in industry, especially in railway industry, to develop complex systems. It covers software development from formal specification to code level. Proof mechanisms guaranty the consistency of specifications properties and the complete consistency of code regarding its formal specification. It is efficient to model  functional  elements of a critical software with respect to  EN50128 constraints.

AtelierB is the industrial  tool the most used to develop critical software.

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}
This section discusses the main usage of the approach.

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which phases do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

Software design & 3 & 3 & 3 & 9 \\
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
Classical B can be used for system design, however it is most adapted to software design. Event-B  based on the same language is better for system analyses \ref{chap:eventB}.
\end{author_comment}


\begin{assessor2}
As classical B is using mathematical expressed conditions and operations to describe the system behaviour it is not suited to understand and present the overall system architecture. It is also difficult to communicate with domain experts based on a classical B model.
\end{assessor2}

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which type of activities do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\end{tabular}


\begin{author_comment}
Classical B  can be used to  validate safety properties.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
As classical b is mainly a strictly formal modelling approach, allowing to use formal proofs for specific constrains. Respectively the strength of this models is to specify the software behaviour and demonstrated that already defined constraints (stated based on earlier system analysis) are holding in this specification. Thereby the abstraction levels are mainly on the lower software level.
\end{assessor2}

\paragraph{Known usages} Have you some examples of usage of this approach to  compare with the OpenETCS objectives ?

\begin{author_comment}

Classical B has been used successfully  in railway  industry (mainly by Alstom, Siemens and AREVA) to  develop critical software in urban (CBTC, PMI,...) and mainline domains (KVB, Eurobalise,...). Hundred of different systems are running in the world embedding software developed in B (see \url{http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wanf/pubs/handbookFFM.pdf}, \url{http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48119-2_22} and \url{http://web.tiscali.it/chiccoterri/Metod B.htm}).

It is also used in nuclear, aeronautic and defence area.

\paragraph{Documentation} Describe how the language is documented, the existing guidelines, coding rules, standardization...

\begin{author_comment}

Language is documented with language manual reference (\url{http://www.atelierb.eu/ressources/manrefb1.8.6.uk.pdf}), tool with the user manual (\url{http://www.tools.clearsy.com/resources/User_uk.pdf}). Industrial have developed their own coding rules and guidelines.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
Since classical B has been used in many industrial and research projects (primarily in France) various introductions, coding rules and guidelines exist. The B book and the AtelierB B manuals present a quasi standard, but no official standard exist.
\end{assessor2}

\paragraph{Language usage} Describe the possible restriction on the language
\begin{author_comment}
Some restrictions in the language manual reference. Industrial guides can add restrictions.
\end{author_comment}

\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Acoording WP2 requirements, how the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification ?

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
Classical B can be used to  support partly  system analysis. However Event B, based on the same language, is more suitable \ref{chap:eventB}.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
Classical B is primarily designed to do software specifications and verify their properties.
\end{assessor2}

\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}


\begin{author_comment}
As a formal language, classical B  can cover some artifacts of semi-formal models.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
Since classical B is a more low level of abstraction formal language, it is difficult to estimate, how it can be used for the more high level work, which first will be done by the semi-formal model. Classical B will definitely be able to work with the SSRS document and demonstrate the coverage, but I is not well suited to build a high level system model.
\end{assessor2}

\end{tabular}


\begin{author_comment}

\end{author_comment}


Does the language allow to  formalize (D.2.6-X-31):

\end{tabular}


\begin{author_comment}
Braking curves have already been specifyed in classical b  in past industrial projects. However this need specific skills.
\end{author_comment}


\begin{assessor2}
The specification of braking curves is not easy in classical B as the time properties are a non trivial modeling aspects in classical B. Therefore these aspects require deep knowledge of B models.
\end{assessor2}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your semi-formal  model is sufficient to cover a safe design of the on-board unit until code generation ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.



\begin{author_comment}
Classical B  approach is well adapted for software design untill code generation. However a formal approach as Event B \ref{chap:eventB} is more relevant to be used for system analysis and design.

\end{tabular}



\begin{author_comment}

\end{author_comment}


\begin{assessor2}
